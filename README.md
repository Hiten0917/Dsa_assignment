//All work done in master instead of main//


Task 1: Balanced Parentheses
Objective: Check if mathematical expressions use balanced brackets.

Requirement: Validate specific strings: a + (b - c) * (d, m + [a - b * (c + d * {m)], and a + (b - c).

Method: Utilize a stack data structure.

Task 2: Infix to Postfix Conversion & Evaluation
Objective: Convert an infix expression to postfix notation and compute its numerical result.

Task 3: Linked List Reverse Traversal
Objective: Implement an algorithm for the reverse traversal of a linked list.

Requirement: Include a main() function to demonstrate the logic.

Task 4: Doubly Linked List (DLL) Implementation
Objective: Implement a DLL using structures.

Functions: Write methods for insertion after a given node and node deletion.

Task 5: Graph Traversal (BFS & DFS)
Objective: Implement an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix.

Functions: Develop Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) techniques for graph traversal.

Task 6: Heap Construction
Objective: Build both min and max heaps from an unsorted data array.

Task 7: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Objective: Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for a weighted graph.

Goal: Find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.

Task 8: Sorting Algorithm Comparison
Objective: Generate N random integers between 1 and 1000.

Sorting Options: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.

Metrics: Print numbers before/after sorting and display the total number of comparisons and swaps performed.
